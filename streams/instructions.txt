1. copy streams-workshop to your computer somewhere

- now we have to put the `stream-adventure` command in your terminal path

2. in a terminal do:

cd streams-workshop/node_modules/stream-adventure
npm link .

- if you get an error try:

sudo npm link .

- if that still doesnt work you can just type

./stream-adventure/streams-workshop/node_modules/stream-adventure/bin/cmd.js

- now you can cd back into streams-workshop (cd ../../) and then finally

stream-adventure
